# Spaces

- Spaces are a smarter and more personalized way to organize your notes and files so that you can stay in focus and in the flow.

## Space - The Basics

- You can use any folder in your system as a Space.
- Spaces are designed so that you can bring together files from across your system.
- You can add items to your space by pinning them from another folder/space or you can add items through a smart search which will automatically pin items to your space based on a search/filter.
- Learn how about what spaces can do and the default spaces in [Introduction to Spaces](https://www.make.md/docs/Spaces/Introduction%20to%20Spaces)

## Navigator

- The Navigator is an easy to use yet powerful tool for getting the most out of your spaces.
- You can use drag and drop to quickly reorder files, pin them to spaces or move/copy files between spaces.

## Space View

- Make each of your spaces personal and interactive to suite the workflow and vibe.
- When you open a space in the main view, you will get a fully customizable view where you can create custom workflows, make a layout or match the vibe.

## Managing Tags

- Manage your tags and navigate them as if they're spaces.

## Context

- Each of your space creates a context which adds structure and meaning to what's inside the space.
    - For example, your book space can now have properties such as author, genre, cover photo, which you can then display, sort and filter anyway you want or connect to other contexts.
- Contexts are extremely powerful yet simple way of creating databases from your space.
