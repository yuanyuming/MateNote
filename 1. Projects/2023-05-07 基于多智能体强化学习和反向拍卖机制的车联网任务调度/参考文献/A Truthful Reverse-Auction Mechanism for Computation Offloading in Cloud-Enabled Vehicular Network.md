## Abstract
The growth of smart vehicles and computation-intensive applications poses new challenges in providing reliable and efficient vehicular services. Offloading such applications from vehicles to mobile edge cloud servers has been considered as a remedy, although resource limitations and coverage constraints of the cloud service may still result in unsatisfactory performance. Recent studies have shown that exploiting the unused resources of nearby vehicles for application execution can augment the computational capabilities of application owners while alleviating heavy on-board workloads. However, encouraging vehicles to share resources or execute applications for others remains a sensitive issue due to user selfishness. To address this issue, we establish a novel computation offloading marketplace in vehicular networks where a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves based reverse auction mechanism utilizing integer linear programming (ILP) problem is formulated while satisfying the desirable economical properties of truthfulness and individual rationality. As ILP has high computation complexity which brings difficulties in implementation under larger and fast changing network topologies, we further develop an efficient unilateral matching-based mechanism, which offers satisfactory suboptimal solutions with polynomial computational complexity, truthfulness and individual rationality properties as well as matching stability. Simulation results show that, as compared with baseline methods, the proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism can greatly improve the system efficiency of vehicular networks in all traffic scenarios.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

THE PAST decade has witnessed the proliferation of mobile traffic, smart devices, and numerous related applications. Given the rapid development and widespread popularity of the Internet of Things and smart mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart vehicles with network access have experienced swift growth in number and variety. ==Vehicular networks are in the process of merging with wireless networks to create a powerful information system.== The advent of LTE and 5G-related technologies has brought enticing prospects to vehicular networks through different communication modes such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication [1]. Furthermore, technological advances including on-board cameras and embedded sensors have inspired new types of applications with innovative features that are computation-intensive, such as intelligent navigation system [2] and augmented reality [3]. Unfortunately, high vehicular mobility, resource limitations, and unsatisfactory computational capabilities of on-board equipment [4],[5] have introduced new challenges to vehicular networks. To cope with the extensive and ever-changing application demands of vehicular terminals, cloud-enabled vehicular networks supported by mobile computation offloading (MCO) [6] technology constitute a new paradigm for improving system performance.

In MCO, by integrating both communication and computing technologies, applications can be offloaded to resourceful and high-performance servers to augment the computational capacities of vehicular terminals while relieving heavy onboard workloads [7]. Compared to accessing a remote central cloud, deploying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers near wireless access points such as base stations (BSs) and road side units (RSUs) can provide wireless users with services that alleviate non-ideal transmission delays and severe degradation. However, mobile edge servers may still experience signal coverage limitations and resource constraints in cases of high user density, especially during high-traffic periods. Therefore, mobile device cloud (MDC) [7], [8]technology has been applied as a strategy for offloading computation-intensive applications to nearby mobile devices with idle resources. Compared with location-fixed mobile edge clouds, the offloading scheme in an MDC environment possesses advantages of infrastructure independency and economic efficiency.

Recently, vehicular cloud (VC) [5], [9] as a novel type of MDC was introduced by leveraging V2V communication technology. In a VC computing scenario, a vehicular terminal can play the part of either a service provider leasing computational resources while charging a certain rate or a service requestor who owns computation-intensive applications. A service requestor can offload certain proportions of applications to one or multiple service providers when V2V connections become available. Moreover, computation results can be transferred back to the requestors directly or via a multi-hop V2V routing path; alternatively, results can be uploaded to RSUs for future delivery in the event of V2V disconnection. Yet two main issues remain with this approach: 1) requestors must determine the computation offloading rate and how to locate appropriate providers and 2) providers have to determine a permissible workload and how much to charge.

Encouraging vehicles to share their resources or execute applications may prove complicated due to user selfishness. The greatest challenge comes with designing a market mechanism tailored to the computation offloading problem while satisfying desirable economical properties, namely achieving a mutually beneficial solution for both parties and building an offloading marketplace with the potential for healthy, sustainable development.

In this paper, we investigate a Vickrey–Clarke–Groves (VCG)-based reverse auction mechanism for V2V computation offloading that addresses the aforementioned issues while considering specific features such as opportunistic connections and different V2V channel conditions in cloud-enabled vehicular networks. Specifically, we envision an offloading market containing several auction groups[1]() with multiple buyers (service requestors) and sellers (service providers). Groups are managed by centralized brokers (RSUs) with innovative policies that can preserve truthfulness and individual rationality. This paper makes the following contributions.

1) We establish a novel scenario in cloud-enabled vehicular networks that enables computation-intensive applications be offloaded via opportunistic V2V channels to overcome the limitations on coverage and resources of location-fixed cloud computing servers.
2) To reduce the application duration and relieve the heavy workload of buyers, a VCG-based reverse auction mechanism is established that offers sellers incentives to lease their idle computation resources, allowing buyers to express diverse preferences for different sellers by mainly considering computational capabilities, data transmission rates and contact duration between vehicles, while controlling economic costs. We model the VCG-based reverse auction mechanism as a integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which is shown to be truthful and individually rational with theoretically optimal offloading results.
3) As the VCG-based reverse auction in ILP model is NP-hard, a unilateral-matching-based algorithm is proposed to greatly reduce computation complexity where a buyer can be effectively matched to an applicable seller while retaining desirable economic properties and maximizing group efficiency. It is shown that the proposed matching scheme is stable and highly practical to implement.
4) We perform a thorough numerical analysis and comparative evaluation of the optimal and the proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism with several baseline methods. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed offloading mechanism can greatly improve system efficiency.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses related work. Section III presents the system model and design targets considered in this paper. We formulate the VCG-based reverse auction mechanism and prove the economic properties in Section IV. In Section V, a unilateral matching-based mechanism is proposed and discussed in detail. Numerical results and performance evaluation are presented in Section VI. This paper is summarized in Section VII.

## 2. RELATED WORK
The increasing popularity of computation-intensive applications offers great convenience but places a substantial burden on vehicular networks and on-board equipment [4], [6]. Such applications often require computational resources beyond the capability of a smart vehicle, presenting a major problem for application owners [7]. With the emergence of MCO and MEC, vehicles can enhance their computational capacity by uploading applications to mobile edge cloud servers. Some research has focused computation offloading mechanisms via V2I communications. An energy-efficient adaptive resource scheduler for networked fog centers was proposed and tested in [10] to exploit the locally measured states of TCP/IP connections to maximize overall communication-plus-computing energy efficiency while meeting application-induced hard quality-of-service requirements of minimum transmission rates, maximum delays, and delay jitters. Zhang _et al._ [11]proposed a hierarchical framework in which a backup computing server is introduced in the neighborhood to compensate for the deficient computational resources of MEC servers. To reduce the latency of the computation offloading of vehicles, a multiple vehicles computation offloading game was studied in vehicular edge networks [12]. Nonetheless, they didn’t consider available onboard resources and advantages of opportunistic contacting between vehicles. While the system performance still leaves some room for improvement, current V2I computation offloading can greatly burden the already overloaded cellular network. Additionally, signal coverage limitations of RSUs (e.g., in remote regions like mountainous and rural areas) can still impose restrictions on offloading schemes.

Therefore, based on green wireless communications [13], opportunistic offloading [7] has been proposed as a solution to solve the aforementioned problems which leverages an opportunistic network formed by VCs to offload applications. To the best of our knowledge, V2V computation offloading mechanisms with considering service price is a novel research direction with little existing work. However, similar opportunistic offloading problems can be summarized into two categories:1) device-to-device (D2D) data offloading and 2) D2D computation offloading. For the former, low data transmission delay and content popularity are major objectives where spectrum is the most scarce resources. In contrast, both transmission delay and application processing duration are necessarily considered where severe limitations on computational resources become big problems in computation offloading cases. For the latter, smartphones always suffer from energy constraints while vehicles are usually considered to have powerful batteries. Furthermore, mobility of smartphone users may be ignored in some scenarios due to low speed, while vehicles move at a high speed which lead to different channel conditions and limited contact durations. Chen _et al._ [4]came up with delay and energy efficient task scheduling methods among smartphone users but ignored the task processing duration and also price strategies. Chen _et al._ [14] proposed a framework in achieving collaborative task executions at the network edge for mobile users which is also mainly focus on energy efficiency.

In V2V computation offloading related vehicular networks, Meng _et al._ [15] investigated a cloud-assisted vehicular network architecture in which all clouds containing remote clouds, local clouds, and VCs have their own features, and a corresponding optimal scheme was obtained by solving a semi-Markov decision process aimed at maximizing the system’s expected average reward. To improve network capacity and system computing capabilities, Yu _et al._ [16] extended the original cloud radio access network to integrate local cloud services where several cloudlets are geographically distributed to provide a low-cost, scalable, self-organizing, and effective solutions, and key technologies of D2D and heterogeneous networks are also considered mainly to increase cloudlets’ resource utilization.

As cloud computing is a type of pay-as-you-go service, it is better to consider economical factors such as personalized service price related to service providers with different capabilities, cost considerations of application owners, and user preferences in the computation offloading marketplace, but offloading limited by contact duration between vehicles is also neglected to some extent in several existing works.

Auctions, which have been widely applied to traffic offloading in wireless communication and cognitive radio networks, constitute a popular trading form contributing to effective price discovery and efficient resource allocation. However, few works have yet applied the auction mechanism to address resource allocation problems along with incentive issues in the computation offloading marketplace. The model in [17] considered only a single buyer of mobile resources, thus omitting the competition among multiple buyers in a general scenario. Jin _et al._ [18] and [19] studied resource sharing for cloudlets in mobile cloud computing and designed efficient auction mechanisms to guarantee truthfulness of the bidders; however, they limited the auction mechanism through one-to-one matching, which neglects the ability of resource-rich devices to support multiple buyers with resource demands in a practical system. Wang _et al._ [20] designed a distributed auction mechanism to allocate tasks fairly through D2D communications and determine the trading prices of resources. The authors also proposed a payment evaluation process to prevent potentially dishonest activities from bidders. In another study by Wang _et al._ [20], heterogeneous and homogeneous task models in mobile networks were considered when designing an auction mechanism through which the properties of individual rationality, truthfulness, and computational efficiency were proven [21]. In [22], the computation offloading problem was modeled as a twostage auction in which remote macro cell user equipment with common social characteristics can form a group and then buy the computation resources of small cell BSs by relaying small cell user equipment. Nevertheless, transmission reliability is difficult to protect through relay-based offloading. An auction can efficiently meet the challenges in the MCO market to some degree; therefore, the question of how to design a truthful and individually rational offloading mechanism by capitalizing on opportunistic contacts and different channel conditions between each pair of vehicles under a cloud-enabled vehicular network framework is an urgent issue warranting careful examination.

## 3. SYSTEM MODEL AND DESIGN TARGETS

### 3.1 System Model

This section first describes participants in the proposed reverse auction mechanism. Then, the cloud-enabled vehicular network framework and basic assumptions are presented in detail. Finally, we illustrate the system models, including V2V contact model and economic model we adopted when designing the VCG-based reverse auction.

### 3.2 Buyer
A buyer (service requestor) is a vehicular user who has a computation-intensive application waiting to be executed, denoted as a four-tuple $b_i=\{d_i,f^B_i,v^B_i,\theta^B_i\}$, where $d_i$ is the data size of the computation-intensive application (bit); $f^B_i$ represents the local computational capability (e.g., CPU cycle/second); and $v^B_i$ and $θ^B_i$ are the velocity and moving direction of buyer $b_i$, respectively. Notably, due to unsatisfactory computational capability and limited on-board resources, a buyer is inclined to offload part or entire of the computation workload to an applicable nearby vehicle (seller) to reduce the application completion duration, improving the quality of experience (QoE).

### 3.3 Seller

A seller (service provider) is a vehicular user who has idle computation resources that can be leased to buyers, helping to relieve the heavy on-board computation workload while receiving a reasonable payment. A seller can be defined as a six-tuple $s_j=\{f^S_,I^S_j,p_j,v^S_j,\theta^S_j,\Phi_j\}$ , where $f^S_j$, $v^S_j$, $\theta^S_j$,respectively, represent the computational capability, velocity, and moving direction of seller $s_j$. $I^R_j$ denotes the idle computational resources that are virtualized into resource blocks such as CPU cycles, and aggregated into a resource pool; $p_j$ and $φ_j$ are the bid and private valuation for processing one-bit application data.

### 3.4 Broker
A broker works as an intermediate agent who hosts and directs auction processes. The broker is responsible for ensuring the auction proceeds smoothly with truthfulness and individual rationality, thus maximizing the utility of buyers while protecting the benefits of sellers. In vehicular networks, a BS or RSU can conduct resource auctions via an auction controller.

As illustrated in the proposed cloud-enabled vehicular network scenario shown by Fig. 1, which contains $N$ buyers $b_i\in \{b_1,b_2,...,b_N\}$ ,and $M$ sellers$s_j\in\{s_1,s_2,...,s_M\}$ , all buyers and sellers have the same communication range $R^V$. Suppose that $N  +  M$ vehicles are moving in a network space $\Omega = [0,\sqrt{(N+M)/\mu]}$, where $μ$ is the density of vehicles per kilometer on the east-west and south-north roads. Several RSUs exist alongside the roads with a coverage radius defined as $R^R$. Vehicles report various information, such as location and velocity, through V2I channels periodically. Any two RSUs can communicate with each other directly through wired links. Basic assumptions are as follows.
1) Assuming that time is slotted, and we study the market for one specific time period.
2) Information absence exist in the offloading market: first, sellers’ private valuations are not visible to brokers and buyers; no seller knows the bids of any other participants, and sellers do not connive with each other. Also, some private information (e.g., buyers’ local computational capability) cannot be publicized to sellers.
3) The velocity and direction of each vehicle remain unchanged during the brief period of auction and offloading [23]; in other words, vehicles maintain a uniform rectilinear motion during the time slot under study.
4) Computation offloading can occur between two vehicles only when a one-hop V2V connection is available to protect the reliability of data transmission. One buyer can only offload his application to one seller, but one seller can provide services for multiple buyers.
5) Buyers and sellers are regarded as premium paid members which bring brokers duties to guide the auction process. In other words, brokers cannot refuse to help any participant in the offloading marketplace.
At the beginning of the time slot under study, the scenario is divided into several connected graphs called “groups.” In a group, each buyer can communicate with at least one seller, and each seller can also communicate with at least one buyer. However, because the reverse auction mechanism on computation offloading can be applied to all groups, we mainly discuss the subsequent work by taking one group as an example.

### 3.5 V2V Contact Model

Given that $Q_i(t)$ and $Q_j(t)$ denote the respective locations of vehicles i and j, we call one contact event between two vehicles that occurs during $t\in[t_1,t_2)$ , if the following conditions are satisfied: $||Q_i(t^-_1)-Q_j(t^-_1)||>R^V, ||Q_i(t)-Q_j(t)||\le R^V$ and $||Q_i(t_2)-Q_j(t_2)||>R^V$,where $||\ \textbullet\ ||$ represents Euclidean distance and $t_1^−$ is considered the time before $t_1$. As vehicles maintain a uniform rectilinear motion during auction and offloading, the contact duration $\Delta t_{ij}$ between $b_i$ and $s_j$ in a group can be obtained easily. Notably, $r_{ij}$ describes the data transmission rate between buyer $i$ and seller $j$ related to several factors including channel condition, packet loss retransmission, transmission power, and outage probability, which can be known from RSUs.

### 3.6 Economic Model
Consider a group containing $n$ buyers $\mathbf{B}= \{b_1,b_2,...,b_N\}$ with demand vector $\mathbf{D}=\{d_1,d_2,...,d_n\}$ and $m$ sellers $\mathbf{S} = \{s_1,s_2,...,s_M\}$with bidding vector $\mathbf{P}=\{p_1,p_2,...,p_m\}$. Each seller $s_j$ has a certain amount of idle computational resources he is willing to lease for a given price $φ_j$, unknown to the broker as well as buyers. The private valuation $φ_j$ can be designed as a function related to computational capability$f^S_j$ shown by the following function, which is monotonously increasing in general:
$$\phi_{j} = U^{S} \left( f^{S}_{j}\right) \tag1$$

In the proposed scenario, we may have $p_j\neq φ_j$. To prevent market distortion, the mechanism proposed in this paper incentivizes sellers to provide true bidding information about the private valuation $p_j= φ_j$ by ensuring no benefits of misreporting.

The utility gain that each seller offers to buyers is nonidentical (e.g., a higher computational capability can bring greater benefit to buyers). Let $ψ_{ij}$ be the utility with the physical significance of time saved if $b_i$ offloads one-bit data to $s_j$ as function where κ is the mapping from bit to CPU cycles. Apparently, higher values of $r_{ij}$ and $f^S_j$ can provide more benefits to $b_i$.

The procedure of the proposed reverse auction for V2V computation offloading includes the following main steps: first, buyers publish their demand vector and sellers provide their bidding vector; then, applicable computation allocation results can be determined by the broker and published to all users in this group. Each buyer can offload his computation workload to the designated seller and get the result after application completion via a one-hop V2V channel. The result feedback duration can be further neglected [12], [24] due to the application result having a much smaller data size than the input data.
$$\begin{array}{c c}{{\psi_{i j}=U^{B}\big(f_{i}^{B},f_{j}^{S},r_{i j}\big)=\frac{\kappa}{f_{i}^{B}}-\left(\frac{1}{r_{i j}}+\frac{\kappa}{f_{j}^{S}}\right)~~~~~~~~~(2)}}\end{array}$$

###  3.7 Design Targets
In this paper, truthfulness and individual rationality are significant targets that have also been selected by many existing auction mechanisms in different fields [23], [25]–[27].

_Definition 1 (Truthfulness):_ An auction has the property of truthfulness if every bidder $s_j\in \mathbf{S}$ holds his bid $p_j$ equals to the private valuation $φ_j$, which is a weakly dominant strategy. (A strategy is weakly dominant if, regardless of what any other bidders do, the strategy earns a bidder a payoff at least as high as any other strategy, and the strategy earns a strictly higher payoff for some profile of other bidders’ strategies. Hence, a strategy is weakly dominant if it is always at least as good as any other strategy, for any profile of other bidders’ actions, and is strictly better for some profile of others’ strategies.)
Under the computation offloading framework in this paper, truthfulness efficiently prevents market manipulation and benefits resource allocation.

_Definition 2 (Individual Rationality):_ An auction is individually rational if all bidders are guaranteed to receive non-negative utility.
In the proposed scenario, each seller is individual rational and encouraged to lease idle computational resources due to that they will not be in a worse position after participating in the auction.

## 4.VCG-BASED REVERSE AUCTION FOR COMPUTATION OFFLOADING

In this section, a VCG-based reverse auction for computation offloading is presented considering that VCG is one of the most well-studied auction mechanisms that can effectively ensure the property of truthfulness [25]. Then, we formalize the objective function by using an ILP model that provides the optimal computation allocation for the reverse auction, namely the sellers to be purchased and the buyer’s computation intensive application that can be offloaded. The corresponding payment role is demonstrated, based on which we analyze the auction properties.

### 4.1 Optimal Computation Allocation
To maximize group efficiency, an ILP model is applied that can provide the optimal computation allocation. Consider the group with buyer set $\mathbf B$ and seller set $\mathbf S$ where each seller has his own communication range and we only consider one-hop V2V computation offloading. Let $R_{sj}$ and $R_{bi}$ be sets containing buyers within the coverage range of $s_j$ and sellers within the coverage range of $b_i$, respectively. The binary variables $ξ_{ij}, b_i,\in \mathbf{B}, s_j\in\mathbf{S}$ indicate the assignment of one buyer to one winning seller. If $ξ_{ij}=1$, $b_i$ can offload his application data to $s_j$ through one-hop V2V communication; $ξ_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Given the above definitions and notations, assuming bidding vector $\mathbf{P}= [p_1, p_2,..., p_m]$ and demand vector $\mathbf{D}= [d_1, d_2,...,d_n]$, the VCG-based reverse auction problem in a multibuyer–multiseller vehicular group can be formulated as follows with corresponding constraints:
$$\mathop{\mathrm{max}}_{\xi_{ij}} \ {{f(\xi_{i j})=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\omega_{i j}\phi_{i j}\bar{\varepsilon}_{i j}d_{i j}-\sum_{j=1}^{m}p_{j}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\bar{\varepsilon}_{i j}d_{i j}}}\tag3 $$

$$ \begin{array}{rlr}
\mathrm{s.t.} &{{\xi_{j}\in\{0,1\}}} & (3a)\\
 & \forall b_{i}\notin R_{s_j},\xi_{ij} \triangleq 0 & (3b)\\
 & \kappa \sum^{n_{i=1}}\xi_{ij}d_{ij}\le I^R_{j}& (3c)\\
 & d_{ij} \triangleq min(d_i, \Delta t_{ij} r_{ij})&(3d)\\
 & \sum^m_{j=1} \xi_{ij} \leq 1.&(3e)
\end{array}$$

$ω_i$ indicates the sensitivity of price and application duration; the larger the value of $ω_i$, the higher price $b_i$ is willing to pay as long as the application duration can be reduced. The objective function (3) represents group efficiency, where $\sum^m_{j=1}\sum^n_{i=1} \Psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}d_{ij}$ denotes the total utility that buyers can obtain by offloading computation data to sellers, whereas the second term coincides with the expected cost that buyers should pay to winning sellers. Constraint (3a) ensures that $ξ_{ij}$ is a binary variable that can only be 0 or 1. Constraint (3b) prevents computation offloading from a buyer to a seller while the buyer is out of the seller’s communication range. Constraint (3c) prevents the total workload offloaded from buyers from exceeding the idle computation resources the seller can provide. Constraint (3d) determines the actual offloaded data from $b_i$ to $s_j$, relying on the smaller value between the entire data and the data can be transmitted during a valid contact duration. Finally, constraint (3e) confirms that one buyer can only be assigned to one seller.

### 4.2 Payment Rule
For the purpose of maintaining healthy market development, we illustrate a payment rule that forces sellers to cite their true valuations for computing service. This rule incentivizes sellers’ participation and effectively prevents them from cheating [28].
The payment to a winning seller $s_k$ is shown as
$$P_{s_{k}}=f{\Big(}\xi_{i j}^{*}{\Big)}-f_{S\backslash\{i j\} }{\Big(}\sigma_{i j}^{*}{\Big)}+p_{k}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{i k}^{*}d_{i k} \tag4$$

where $ξ^∗_{ij}$ is the optimal allocation for computation offloading under a given bidding vector, and $f(ξ^∗_{ij})$ is the maximum value of group efficiency. $f_{\mathbf{S} \backslash \{S_k\}}(\sigma^∗_{ij})$ denotes the maximum group efficiency when $s_k$ does not participate in the auction where the corresponding optimal allocation without $s_k$ is presented as $\sigma^∗_{ij}$.

### 4.3 Truthfulness and Individual Rationality

_Theorem 1 (Truthfulness):_ In the VCG-based reverse auction of computation offloading marketplace, for each $s_k∈ S$ , having his bid equal to his private valuation $(pk = φk)$ is a weakly dominant strategy.
_Proof:_ For $s_k$ under a given bidding vector of other sellers in the group, we consider two cases.

_Case 1:_ $s_k$ publishes his bid $p_k$ equals to the true valuation $φ_k(p_k = φ_k)$ , and the utility can be denoted as
$$u_{k}=f{\left(\xi_{i j}^{*}\right)}-f_{S\backslash\{S_{k}\}}{\left(\sigma_{i j}^{*}\right)}.\tag5$$

_Case 2:_ sk misreports his bid denoted as $p'_k(p'_k\neq \phi_k)$, the utility can be expressed as
$$u_{k}^{\prime}=f{\left(\xi_{i j}^{*\prime}\right)}-f_{S\backslash\{s_{k}\}}{\left(\sigma_{i j}^{*\prime}\right)}+p_{k}^{\prime}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{i k}^{*\prime}d_{i k}-\phi_{k}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{i k}^{*\prime}d_{i k}.\tag6$$
Here,
$\begin{array}{l}{{f_{S}\backslash\{s_{k}\}\left(\sigma_{i j}^{\ast}\right)\ =\ f_{S}\backslash\{s_{k}\}\left(\sigma_{i j}^{\ast k^{\prime}}\right)}}\end{array}$, and the difference between utility of the above two cases can be calculated by
$$
\begin{aligned}u_k-u_k^{\prime}=f\Big(\xi_{ij}^*\Big)-f\Big(\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}\Big)-p_k^{\prime}\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}+\phi_k\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}\end{aligned}\tag7
$$
Where
$$
f\Big(\xi_{ij}^*\Big)=\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{i\in R_{sj}}\omega_i\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}-\sum_{j=1}^mp_j\sum_{b_i\in R_{sj}}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}\tag8
$$
And
$$
\begin{aligned}f\Big(\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}\Big)&=\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\omega_i\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}-\sum_{j\neq k}^mp_j\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}-p_k'\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}.\end{aligned}\tag9
$$

Thus, (7) can be written as
$$
\begin{array}
{rl}
u_{k}-u_{k}^{\prime} =&\left[\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\omega_i\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}-\sum_{j=1}^mp_j\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}\right] \\
 & -\left[\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{j}}}\omega_{i}\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}-\sum_{j\neq k}^{m}p_{j}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{j}}}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}\right.\\
 &  \left.-p_{k}^{\prime}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}\right]-p_{k}^{\prime}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}
 \\
 & +\phi_{k}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}\xi_{ik}^{*\prime}d_{ik}
\\
=& \left[\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\omega_i\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}-\sum_{j=1}^mp_j\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_j}}\xi_{ij}^*d_{ij}\right] \\
& -\left[\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{j}}}\omega_{i}\psi_{ij}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}-\sum_{j=1}^{m}p_{j}\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{j}}}\xi_{ij}^{*\prime}d_{ij}\right].
\end{array}\tag{10}
$$

Given a bidding vector $\mathbf{P}=[p_1,p_2,...,p_m]$ , $ξ^*_{ij}$ represents the optimal solution of computation offloading which is always better than other solutions (e.g., $ξ^{*'}_{ij}$). Therefore, we have $u_k − u^{'}_k > 0$; if and only if $ξ^*_{ij}=ξ^{*'}_{ij}$ , then $u_k − u^{'}_k = 0$.
Consequently, sellers cannot obtain better benefits by cheating and are hence willing to report the private true price for each buyer.

_Theorem 2 (Individual Rationality):_ The VCG-based reverse auction in the computation offloading marketplace has the property of individual rationality.
_Proof:_ Given that the VCG-based reverse auction is truthful $\forall s_k\in\mathbf{S},p_k=\phi_k$ and the optimal computation offloading solution can be found. According to the payment rule in (4), the utility of a winning seller $s_k$ can be denoted as (5), where $ξ^{*}_{ij}$ and $\sigma^*_{ij}$ denotes the optimal solution when $s_k$ has joined and not joined in the auction, respectively.
Define a set $\mathbf{S}'=\mathbf{S} \backslash \{s_k\}$ , we consider the following two cases.
Case 1: $f(ξ^{*}_{ij}) \ge f_{\mathbf{S} \backslash \{s_k\}}(\sigma^*_{ij})$ , then $u_k$ ≥ 0. Hence, $s_k$ will get non-negative utility after participating in the auction.
Case 2: $f(ξ^{*}_{ij}) \lt f_{\mathbf{S} \backslash \{s_k\}}(\sigma^*_{ij})$ . Since $\mathbf{S}' \subset \mathbf{S}$ and buyers in the group can have more computation offloading options with S rather than with S', for maximizing group efficiency, which brings, $f(ξ^{*}_{ij}) \gt f_{\mathbf{S} \backslash \{s_k\}}(\sigma^*_{ij})$ and $u_k\ge 0$. Correspondingly, case 2 will never exist.
As a result, the VCG-based reverse auction in the computation offloading marketplace has the property of individual rationality.

TABLE II OPTIMAL VCG-BASED REVERSE AUCTION

Hereafter, we illustrate the algorithm implementing the optimal computation offloading auction run by a broker to map buyers to sellers for the purpose of maximizing group efficiency while ensuring truthfulness and individual rationality. The algorithm of the VCG-based reverse auction is shown in Table II, where $\mathit{f^B} = \{f^B_1,f^B_2,...,f^B_n\}$ and are the computational capability vectors of the buyer and seller, and $\Delta t=\{\Delta t_{ij}|b_i\in\mathbf{B},s_j\in \mathbf{S}\}$and $r= \{r_{ij}|b_i\in\mathbf{B},s_j\in \mathbf{S}\}$ denote the sets of contact duration and data transmission rate between buyers and sellers, respectively. The idle resources vector of sellers can be represented as $I^R=\{I^R_1,I^R_2,...,I^R_m\}$. Given the input parameters, the binary variables $ξ_{ij}$ that maximize the objective function in (3) can be obtained. Total payments to winning sellers are calculated according to the payment rule in (4), which guarantees a truthful auction.

The VCG mechanism ensures truthfulness only when the optimal solution can be found. Unfortunately, the VCG-based reverse auction problem detailed in Table II is NP-hard; therefore, a broker can rarely identify a solution to reconfigure the vehicular network extemporaneously, as the computation time necessary to solve large and real-life network cases increases sharply in line with network size and vehicular density. However, in small-size network scenarios with low vehicular density, we can solve the computation offloading problem optimally.

## 5. UNILATERAL-MATCHING-BASED REVERSE AUCTION FOR COMPUTATION OFFLOADING
In this section, we propose an efficient unilateral-matching based mechanism to obtain suboptimal solutions of the computation offloading problem in polynomial time. We demonstrate that the mechanism preserves the truthfulness property, which enables the trading market to take a tougher stance against cheating behavior that attempts to eliminate honest sellers. Several important properties including individual rationality, matching stability, and polynomial computation complexity are also applicable.

### 5.1 Unilateral-Matching-Based Mechanism and the Corresponding Payment Rule

We first define preference lists from the respective perspectives of the broker and buyers. For the broker in one group, a preference list $L_{broker}=\{((b_i,s_i)\succ_{broker}(b_i,R_{b_i}\backslash\{s_j\}))|b_i\in \mathbf{B},s_j\in \mathbf{S}\}$ can be created according to the value of $(\omega_i\psi_{ij}-p_j)d_{ij}, b_i\in\mathbf{B},s_j\in\mathbf{S}$ in nonascending order, where operator indicates the broker prefers matching $b_i$ to $s_j$ rather than other sellers in set $R_{b_i}$ to maximize group efficiency.

Then, each buyer $b_i\in \mathbf{B}$ has his own preference list $L_{b_i}=\{(s_j\succ_{b_i},s_k |s_j \in R_{b_i}\}$ sorted by the value of $(\omega_i\psi_{ij}-p_j)d_{ij}$ , where a preference relation$\succ_{b_i}$ means that $s_j$ can bring greater benefit to buyer $b_i$ compared to $s_k$. To ensure the truthfulness of the matching algorithm, we add a virtual seller $s_{i'}$ as a critical indicator that represents the buyer $b_i$ at the end of list $L_{b_i}$ ; moreover, we make the critical value $λ_{i'}$ slightly smaller than all $(\omega_i\psi_{ij}-p_j)d_{ij}$ alues in $L_{b_i}$. If no seller in $L_{b_i}$wins the auction, then virtual seller $s_{i'}$ (buyer $b_i$)will execute the computation-intensive application locally. In particular, if $(\omega_i\psi_{ij}-p_j)d_{ij}\le 0$, then set $\xi_{ij} \triangleq 0$ indicates that $b_i$ will not offload his data to $s_j$ due to nonpositive utility; any seller $s_j$ who leads $(\omega_i\psi_{ij}-p_j)d_{ij}$ less than or equal to zero cannot exist in $L_{b_i}$.

The mobile computation allocation stage and payment decision stage are contained in the proposed unilateral-matching based mechanism. List $L_{broker}$ will be mainly referred to in the first stage to maximize group efficiency despite the possibility of sacrificing some buyers’ benefits. For example, $s_k$ is at the top of both lists $L_{b_i}$ and $L_{b_j}$ , but the broker will match $b_i$ to $s_k$ first due to$(\omega_i\psi_{ik}-p_k)d_{ik}\lt (\omega_i\psi_{jk}-p_k)d_{jk}$ ,in $L_{broker}$.
![[Pasted image 20230730105427.png]]
TABLE III PROPOSED MATCHING ALGORITHM IN REVERSE AUCTION

The concrete unilateral-matching-based mechanism is summarized in Table [III]. In the mobile computation allocation stage, given the input parameters, we create $L_{broker}$ and match buyers to appropriate sellers based on $L_{broker}$ until all buyers are matched or sellers have run out of idle resources. In the payment decision stage, for a pair $(b_i,s_j)$ in the previous stage, the critical indicator can be chosen as $s_\hat{j}$, which is located behind $s_j$ in list $L_{b_i}$ . The payment to the winning seller $s_j$ is represented as $P^M_{s_j}$ and shown in
$$P_{s j}^{M}=\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_j}}\left(\omega_{i}\psi_{i j}-\frac{\left(\omega_{i}\psi_\hat{i j}-p_\hat{j}\right)d_\hat{i j}}{d_{i j}}\right)\xi_{i k}d_{i j}.\tag{11}$$
If $s_j$ is the last real seller in list $L_{bi}$ then let $(\omega_i\psi_\hat{ij}-p_\hat{j})d_\hat{ij}=\lambda_{i'}$.

### 5.2 Properties
_Theorem 3 (Truthfulness):_ The proposed unilateralmatching-based mechanism is truthful. For each seller, setting his bid equal to the private valuation is a weakly dominant strategy.
_Proof:_ Here, for each seller $s_k$, we consider utility $u_k$ when $s_k$ sets his bid as $p_k$ = $φ_k$, denoted in
$$u_{k}=P_{s_{k}}^{M}-\sum_{b_{i}\in R_{s_{k}}}^{}\,\phi_{k}\xi_{i k}d_{i k}.\tag{12}$$

Besides, a virtual seller $s'_k$ with untruthful bid $p'_k\neq \phi_k$ is considered as the case that $s'_k$ cheats in the auction. Note that $s'_k$ has the same properties with $s_k$ except for the bid, the utility of $s'_k$ is shown in
$$\begin{array}{l l}{{u_{k}^{\prime}={P}_{s_{k}^{\prime}}^{M}-\sum_{\displaystyle b_{i}\in{R}_{s_{k}}}\phi_{k}\xi_{i k}d_{i k}.}}\end{array}\tag{13}$$

Then, the following two cases are relevant.
_Case 1_: The untruthful bid $p'_k$ of seller $s'_k$ is smaller than private valuation $\phi_k$.

When $p'_k<\phi_k$ , if $s'_k$ wins the auction. we can calculate the utility $u'_k$ as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}u'_k&=\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\left(\omega_i\psi_{ik}-\frac{(\omega_i\psi_{i\hat{k'}}-p_{\hat{k'}})d_{i\hat{k'}}}{d_{ik}}\right)\xi_{ik}d_{ik}-\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\phi_k\xi_{ik}d_{ik}\end{aligned}\tag{14}
$$

where $s_\hat{k}$this the seller behind $s'_k$ in list $L_{b_i}$. Correspondingly, when $s_k$ wins the auction, $u_k$ can be calculated as
$$
\begin{aligned}u_k&=\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\left(\omega_i\psi_{ik}-\frac{(\omega_i\psi_{i\hat{k}}-p_{\hat{k}})d_{\hat{ik}}}{d_{ik}}\right)\xi_{ik}d_{ik}-\sum_{b_i\in R_{s_k}}\phi_k\xi_{ik}d_{ik}\end{aligned}\tag{14}
$$

According to list $L_{bi}$ , it is obvious to obtain $(ω_iψ_{i\hat{k'}}− p_k)d_{i\hat{k'}} ≥ (ω_iψ_{i\hat{k}} − p_\hat{k})d_{ik}$, which leads to $u'_k ≤ u_k$. In conclusion, seller sk has no motivation to cheat.

_Case 2:_ The untruthful bid $p'_k$ of seller $s'_k$ is larger than private valuation $φ_k$. When $p'_k >φ_k$, it is obvious that $(ω_iψ_{ik}− p_k)d_{ik} ≥ (ω_iψ_{ik} − p'_k)d_{ik}$.If $s'_k \succ_{bi} s_k$ and $s_k \succ_{bi} s_\hat{k}$ are adjacent to each other in list Lbi , due to that sˆk is the only critical indicator, we have $u_k = u'_k = \sum_{bi∈R_{s_k}} (ω_iψ_{ik} − ([(ω_iψ_{i\hat{k}}−p_\hat{k})d_{i\hat{k}'}]/d_{ik}))ξ_{ik}d_{ik} − \sum_{b_i∈R_{s_k}} φ_kξ_{ik}d_{ik}$. Thus, there is no need for seller $s_k$ to cheat in the auction. Otherwise, when there is a $s_\hat{k}$ between $s_k$ and $s'_k$ in $L_{b_i}$ ,if $s'_k$ wins the auction, $s_\hat{k}$ will definitely win which causes $u'_k = 0$ due to that only one winner can be matched to buyer $b_i$. As a result, $s_k$ will not misreport his bid.
Overall, each seller $s_k ∈ S$ has no incentive to cheat in the proposed unilateral-matching-based auction that has the property of truthfulness.

_Theorem 4 (Individual Rationality):_ The proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism has the property of individual rationality.
Proof: Given the utility of a seller $s_k$ when he wins the auction defined in (12), note that $s_\hat{k}$ locates behind $s_k$ in list $L_{b_i}$ which means $(ω_iψ_{i\hat{k'}}− p_k)d_{i\hat{k'}} \le (ω_iψ_{ik} − p_k)d_{ik}$. Hence, we have
$$p_{k}\le\left(\omega_{i}\psi_{i k}-\frac{\left(\omega_{i}\psi_{i\dot{k}}-p_{\dot{k}}\right)d_{i\dot{k}}}{d_{i k}}\right).\tag{16}$$

According to (11) and (12), $u_k ≥ 0$. As a conclusion, sellers in the proposed matching-based mechanism are individually rational.

Although individual rationality property makes sellers will ing to participate in the auction, brokers and buyers are selfish and acting out of their own interests. Hence, a stable matching is desirable in the computation offloading marketplace, which takes into account individual preferences of both buyers and brokers, producing a matching result that no participants have incentives to deviate from.

_Definition 3 (Stability [30]):_ A stable matching ensures that no buyer or seller is willing to deviate from the current matching result.
_Theorem 5:_ The proposed unilateral-matching-based mech anism on computation offloading is stable.
_Proof:_ Based on the definition of a reverse auction, buyers act as tenderees who have more initiatives; in other words, sell ers cannot refuse to provide service if they win in the proposed scenario. Information absence also causes sellers to know little about buyers. Consider a case in which $b_i$ is matched to $s_j$, where $b_i$ may have two possible options.
_Option 1:_ $b_i$ can withdraw from the auction, after which the computation-intensive application will be executed locally, resulting in larger latency than offloading workloads to sellers and thus causing nonpositive utility.
_Option 2:_ $b_i$ asks to switch to a seller that offers more benefits. According to $L_{b_i}$ and $L_{broker}$, in the interest of maximizing group efficiency, the sellers located before $s_j$ in $L_{b_i}$ have no more idle resources to fulfill the demands of $b_i$.
As a result, to obtain non-negative utility, any buyer or seller will not break off from the current matching result.
For computation complexity, the ILP problem that describes the optimal reverse auction shown by (3) is NP-hard with computation allocation complexity $O(2^{mn})$ and payment com putation complexity $O(m2^{mn})$, which is difficult to imple ment in large and real-life networks. However, the proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism provides low compu tational complexity which can greatly adapt to high traffic scenarios.
_Remark 1:_ The proposed unilateral-matching-based mecha nism shown in Table III has computation complexity $O(m^2n^2)$ for $m =|S|,n =|B|$ due to that selection sort algorithm is utilized in generating lists $L_{broker}$ and $L_{b_i}$ , which can greatly reduce the complexity than the ILP problem and better implement in larger and fast changing topologies.

## 6. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE

This section presents numerical results illustrating the validity of the proposed mechanisms to implement a computational resource-trading marketplace to foster MCO. We evaluate and compare the running time as well as the impact of vehicular density on the performance of the VCG-based auction (Opt) and the proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism (Subopt) with several baseline methods [31] described as follows.

1) _Fastest Processing Scheme (FPS):_ In this scheme, assuming that all sellers bid truthfully, a buyer is always matched to the seller that can fastest complete the application, and offloads computation under the opportunistic V2V contacting constraint. If this seller has run out of idle resources, the buyer is forced to find another fast processing seller or execute application locally.
2) _Lowest Cost Scheme (LCS):_ In this scheme, assuming that all sellers bid truthfully, a buyer is always matched to a seller that has the lowest unit server price, and offloads computation under the opportunistic V2V contacting constraint. If this seller has run out of idle resources, the buyer is forced to find another low price seller or process application locally.
3) _First Come First Serve (FCFS):_ In this scheme, assuming that all sellers bid truthfully, a buyer is always matched to the first accessing seller, and offloads computation under the opportunistic V2V contacting constraint. If this seller has run out of idle resources, the buyer is forced to process application locally. FCFS can be regarded as a random offloading scheme due to that vehicles are randomly distributed on roads in the simulation region.
4) _Local Processing Scheme (LPS):_ In this scheme, all buyers process their computation-intensive applications locally without offloading.

We first describe the simulation setup, then analyze and discuss the performance comparison of different schemes. The economic properties of truthfulness and individual rationality are also found to be valid in the proposed unilateral-matchingbased mechanism under computation offloading marketplace.

### 6.1. Simulation Setup
As mentioned earlier, the VCG-based reverse auction and proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism can be processed independently in each group. In this section, we observe a 350x350 m2 network region containing six east-west and south-north roads as a group with randomly distributed buyers and sellers, where each road has six lanes, on the platform of MATLAB 2017a. An RSU is acted as the centralized broker spaced in the above-mentioned area which hosts and directs auction processes.

In each simulation, only the number of vehicles and the data size of each application are fixed, 1000 simulations with different buyers’ as well as sellers’ parameters (vehicular locations, velocities, directions, computation capabilities, etc., which also lead to different contact durations and data transmission rates between different pair of vehicles) are run to cover various traffic conditions. Through simulation, sufficient results can be obtained to prove that mechanisms presented in this paper are efficient in a variety of vehicular network environments. We apply the function $φ_j = af^S_j+c$ as the private valuation of seller $s_j$ where $a$ and $c$ are positive constants by following the law of offloading marketplace economy, which means the more powerful computational capability a seller $s_j$ provides, the larger private valuation can be charged. The local completion time of the application for buyer $b_i$ without offloading is calculated as $t^L_i = κd_i/f^B_i$, and $t^O_i = max(κ(d_i − d_{ij})/f^B_i ,d_{ij}/r_{ij} + κd_{ij}/f^S_j)$ represents the application completion time when offloading occurs. Relevant simulation parameters are detailed in Table [IV].

TABLE IV SIMULATION PARAMETER SETTINGS

### 6.2 Performance on Running Time
We first compare the running time performance of the VCGbased optimal auction with the proposed unilateral-matchingbased suboptimal mechanism in each group as shown in Fig. [2].
![[Pasted image 20230730162523.png]]
Fig. 2. Comparison on running time between the optimal and suboptimal methods with the number of participants.

In order to make the discussion convictive and generalized for various traffic cases, we evaluate 1000 times simulation per group under different traffic conditions (e.g., different traffic parameters such as vehicular locations, velocities and directions). The running time maintains a consistently low value (near zero) in the suboptimal method and takes no more than 10 s in the optimal method when the number of buyers and sellers less than 5. However, running time in the optimal method grows rapidly as the number of participants increased, exceeding 25 s when $n=m=6$ in one simulation and nearly 7.5 h for 1000 times simulation, which will inevitably result in an infeasible duration for implementation in realistic vehicular networks with rapidly changing network topology and increasing vehicular density.

### 6.3 Traffic Density Analysis
We evaluate the effects of traffic density on each group’s performance under low-traffic, normal-traffic, and rush-hour conditions. Correspondingly, different traffic levels (low, mod erate, and high) are considered corresponding, respectively, to different number of participants in each group. Similarly, we do 1000 simulations per group (1000 times simulation for each point in figures) with different features, in order to cover various traffic conditions.
![[Pasted image 20230730162808.png]]
Fig. 3. Performance measured in low-traffic vehicular network scenarios. Average (a) application completion time (four buyers), (b) value of $f(ξ_{ij})$ (four buyers), and (c) number of winning pairs (four buyers). Average (d) application completion time (six buyers), (e) value of $f(ξ_{ij})$ (six buyers), and (f) number of winning pairs (six buyers).
Fig. 3 displays comparisons on the average application completion time shown in Fig. 3(a) and (d), the average value of group efficiency f(ξij) shown in Fig. 3(b) and (e)] and the average number of buyer-seller pairs shown in Fig. 3(c) and (f) that successfully win in the proposed auctions under low-traffic vehicular network scenarios with increasing number of sellers from m = 1tom = 6. Performance on VCG based optimal method, the proposed unilateral-matching-based suboptimal method, and baseline methods are considered with n = 4 and n = 6 buyers, respectively. According to Fig. 3(a) and (d), curves depict the average application comple tion time of LPS are consistently highest due to buyers’ limited computational capabilities while curves decreasing gradually with increasing sellers for LCS and FCFS due to that buy ers have more options to offload their workloads, but still stay higher than the other three methods. As for the optimal, suboptimal and FPS method, the average application com pletion time declines as the number of sellers increased due to gradually sufficient computational resources. Additionally, performance of the suboptimal and FPS method stays close to each other, nearly approach the optimal solutions, which indicates that the proposed method with low computation com plexity has satisfying performance on application completion time. Then, the group efficiency f(ξij) is discussed and evalu ated in Fig. 3(b) and (e). With increasing number of sellers, the value of f(ξij) increases in all methods due to that more buy ers can enjoy computing services and finally reach relatively stabilities where most buyers can be successfully matched to appropriate sellers. The proposed unilateral-matching-based suboptimal solutions are approximate to the optimal ones and will greatly improve the system efficiency while other baseline methods are always staying at lower levels due to that FPS does not care about buyer’s payment costs, LCS has a lack of time consideration, and FCFS is regarded as a kind of randomly chosen mechanism without any user preference. Moreover, we compare the number of average winning pairs in each group as Fig. 3(c) and (f). A winning pair contains one seller who wins the auction and one buyer who is enabled by the broker to offload his computational workload to the corre sponding seller (in baseline methods, a winning pair contains a seller and a buyer that can be mapped to each other, where the buyer is able to offload computation to the seller). Notably, some buyers might not be admitted under a small number of sellers owing to idle resources and communication range lim itations. However, as the number of sellers increases, so does the average number of winning pairs. Suboptimal solutions are close to the optimal ones and perform better than other baseline methods, in other words, the proposed unilateral matching-based mechanism can better serve vehicular users in the marketplace.

![[Pasted image 20230730163026.png]]
Fig. 4. Performance measured in moderate-traffic vehicular network scenarios. Average (a) application completion time (eight buyers), (b) value of $f(ξ_{ij})$ (eight buyers), and (c) number of winning pairs (eight buyers). Average (d) application completion time (ten buyers), (e) value of $f(ξ_{ij})$ (ten buyers), and (f) number of winning pairs (ten buyers). Average (g) application completion time (12 buyers), (h) value of $f(ξ_{ij})$ (12 buyers), and (i) number of winning pairs (12 buyers).

Fig. 4 describes the performance of the average application completion time [shown in Fig. 4(a), (d), and (g)], the aver age value of function f(ξij) [shown in Fig. 4(b), (e), and(h)] and the average number of winning pairs [shown in Fig. 4(c), (f), and (i)] under moderate-traffic vehicular network scenarios with increasing number of sellers from m = 7to m=12. Due to that the VCG-based reverse auction modeled by ILP problem is NP-hard with exponential rising running time, especially with larger number of participants (shown in Fig. 2), the optimal solutions are not considered in moderate and high traffic cases. Thus, comparisons on the proposed sub optimal method and baseline methods are taken into account with different number of buyers n = 8, n = 10, and n = 12, respectively. Fig. 4(a), (d), and (g) demonstrates that the appli cation completion time of LPS method stays much higher than all other methods which has the similar reasons with low traffic scenarios. For FCFS and LCS, curves decline gently due to that more buyers can enjoy computing service with sellers increased and rise a little bit higher in LCS owing to that buyers always choose sellers who charge less. The pro posed suboptimal method has delicate differences with FPS on application completion time and stays low, which indicates that applications will be completed in advance, reducing the required operational time by approximately 70% and greatly improving group efficiency and QoE. Then, comparisons on group efficiency are detailed in Fig. 4(b), (e), and (h) where the proposed method keeps the highest level than other methods by comprehensively considering both application completion time as well as costs, so that brings more benefits to participants in each group. In Fig. 4(c), (f), and (i), we generally analyze the average number of winning pairs to evaluate how many partic ipants can enjoy service offered by the computation offloading marketplace. As can be seen from these figures that the pro posed method achieves the best conditions where most buyers are matched to appropriate sellers with the number of sellers increased; in other words, more participants under guidance of the proposed mechanism can enjoy the computing service than other methods. Fig. 5 presents the performance of the average application completion time [shown in Fig. 5(a), (d), and (g)], the average value of function f(ξij) [shown in Fig. 5(b), (e), and (h)] and the average number of winning pairs [shown in Fig. 5(c), (f), and (i)] in high-traffic vehicular network sce narios during rush hours, with number of sellers increased from m = 13 to m = 18. Similar to Fig. 4, the applica tion completion time of LPS under circumstances of n = 14, n =16, and n = 18 are much larger than that in the proposed method as well as baseline methods and computation-intensive applications can be processed nearly 75% faster by the pro posed method than local execution. Buyers in rush hours are more likely to be satisfied as vehicular densities are larger than the aforementioned low and moderate traffic scenarios, which bring about relatively stable completion time in FPS, LCS, and the proposed method. For the group efficiency analysis shown in Fig. 5(b), (e), and (h), performance of the proposed method is always better than that of baseline methods, which can effec tively improve system efficiency in the computation offloading marketplace. Finally, evaluation on the average number of win ning pairs is discussed in Fig. 5(c), (f), and (i). We can clearly see from figures that the proposed unilateral-matching-based method can better serve participants in the group than other baseline methods and therefore implement an efficient system.

### 6.4 Performance on Truthfulness and Individual Rationality
We conduct simulations to evaluate the economic proper ties of truthfulness and individual rationality in the proposed unilateral-matching-based mechanism. Performance on guar anteeing the truthfulness of bidders is shown in Fig. 6.We simulate untruthful and truthful activities of a seller sq ran domly chosen in the group and the value on the x-axis is defined as his submitted bid. We evaluate the changes in utility under conditions of sq submits untruthful bids and the private valuation. As analyzed in Theorem 3, submitting untruthful bids cannot increase the utility of sq. Fifteen winning sellers are randomly selected and their sub mitted bids as well as corresponding payments are presented under conditions of m = 20 and n = 20. As shown in Fig. 7, the final payment each seller earned is no less than his bid. Therefore, individual rationality can be achieved in the proposed mechanism, thus validating the theoretical analysis.

## 7. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we consider an MCO problem in a cloudenabled vehicular network. To capture the interactions between service requestors and providers, we construct a centralized reverse auction model based on the VCG mechanism where requestors act as buyers and providers act as sellers by taking into account opportunistic contacts and different channel conditions between vehicles while satisfying the desirable economic properties of truthfulness and individual rationality. Optimal resource allocation results can be obtained to maximize group efficiency, but requiring high computation complexity. Therefore, a unilateral-matching-based mechanism is proposed, which exhibits satisfactory economic properties along with polynomial computational complexity. Compared to the VCG-based mechanism and baseline methods, the proposed mechanism also proves to be better suited in moderate and large size network realization according to performance evaluation.
