1. Initialization: For each server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S$, initialize its resource vector $\mathbf r_i$, cost $c_i$, and bidding strategy $\pi_i$; initialize the offloading task set $\mathcal U=\{\mathcal U_1,\dots,\mathcal U_T\}$.
2. For each time slot $t=1,2,\dots,T$, perform the following steps:
   1. For each server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S$ in the server cluster, update its resource usage and settle the revenue of the previous time slot $p_{t-1,i}-c_i$
   2. Select the buyer vehicle request $\mathbf b_j$ from $\mathcal U_t$ in chronological order, then perform the following steps:
      1. The vehicle evaluates its own connection status and generates the server constraint vector $\mathbf \sigma_j$ for the task.
      2. The vehicle sends the task offloading request $\mathbf f_j$ to the set of servers that meet the constraint condition $\mathcal S_j = \{\mathbf s_i | \forall \mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S, \sigma_{j,i} = 1\}$.
      3. For each server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S_j$, if its available resource $r_{s_i}(t)$ can meet the resource demand of the task $r_{\theta_j}(t)$, then perform the following steps:
         1. The server calculates its own bid for the task $q_{j,i}$ according to its own resource usage situation $\mathbf r_{s_i,t}$ and task characteristics $\mathbf f_j$ in the time period $[t,t+\epsilon]$, as well as the bidding strategy $\pi_i$.
         2. The server returns the bid $q_{j,i}$ to the vehicle.
      4. The vehicle collects all the bids from the servers $\mathcal Q_j = \{q_{j,i} | \forall \mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S_j\}$ and sorts them in non-decreasing order.
      5. The vehicle selects the lowest bidder as the winner $\mathbf s_k =\mathop{\arg\min}\limits_{\mathbf s_i}\ q_{j,i}$, and checks whether its bid $p_j = q_{j,k}$ satisfies the budget condition $p_j \leq \psi_j$. If not, then this auction fails and the task offloading fails; if yes, then this auction succeeds and the task offloading succeeds, and perform the following steps:
         1. The vehicle sends the task to the winning server $\mathbf s_k$ and pays $p_j$, waiting for the execution result to return.
         2. The server $\mathbf s_k$ obtains revenue, allocates resources for the task and performs task offloading, updates its own resource usage situation $\mathbf r_{s_i,t}$
      6. Update task offloading result $\mathcal R$
3. When reaching total time step $T$, offloading ends
