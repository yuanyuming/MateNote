1. Initialization: For each server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S$, initialize its resource vector $\mathbf r_i$, cost $c_i$, and bidding strategy $\pi_i$; initialize the offloading task set $\mathcal U=\{\mathcal U_1,\dots,\mathcal U_T\}$.
2. For each time slot $t=1,2,\dots,T$:
   1. For each server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S$ , update $\mathbf{r}_i$ and $\mathbf R_i$
   2. For request $\mathbf b_j$ from $\mathcal U_t$:
      2. The vehicle sends request $\mathbf f_j$ to $\mathcal S_j = \{\mathbf s_i | \forall \mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S, \sigma_{j,i} = 1\}$.
      3. For server $\mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S_j$:
	      1. If its available resource $r_{s_i}(t)$ can meet the resource demand:
	         1. The server $\mathbf s_i$ calculates its own bid $q_{j,i}$ according to its bidding strategy $\pi_i$.
	         2. The server returns the bid $q_{j,i}$ to the vehicle.
	     1. Else:
		     1. The server returns the bid $q_{j,i}=\infty$ to the vehicle.
      4. The vehicle collects all the bids from the servers $\mathcal Q_j = \{q_{j,i} | \forall \mathbf s_i \in \mathcal S_j\}$ and sorts them in non-decreasing order.
      5. The vehicle selects the winner $\mathbf s_k =\mathop{\arg\min}\limits_{\mathbf s_i}\ q_{j,i}$,:
	      1. If $p_j \leq \psi_j$:
	         1. The vehicle sends the task to the winning server $\mathbf s_k$ and pays $p_j$, waiting for the execution result to return.
	         2. The server $\mathbf s_k$ obtains revenue, allocates resources for the task and performs task offloading, updates its own resource usage situation $\mathbf r_{s_i,t}$
	     2. Else this auction fails.
      6. Update task offloading result $\mathcal R$
3. When reaching total time step $T$, offloading ends
