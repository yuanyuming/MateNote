随着智能交通技术的快速发展，车联网作为一种新兴的网络模式，正逐渐受到广泛关注。在车联网环境下，如何有效地利用系统资源，提高任务执行效率，成为一个亟待解决的问题。本文旨在最大化系统资源的利用率，提高车联网中任务卸载的整体执行效率，使车辆能够通过互联网访问各种智能服务。由于车辆的计算能力和能量有限，任务卸载可以通过利用边缘服务器来提高复杂和耗时任务的性能和效率。然而，任务卸载也涉及到多个车辆和服务器之间的权衡和协调，这对任务和资源分配提出了重大挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种将多智能体强化学习和反向拍卖机制相结合的新方法，使车辆和服务器能够学习和优化任务卸载的竞标策略，实现公平高效的结果。我们采用近端策略优化（PPO）算法和长短期记忆（LSTM）网络来训练多智能体强化学习模型。在我们基于 Python 的开源模拟环境 VehicleJobScheduling 中进行了广泛的实验，该环境真实地模拟了车联网场景，并提供了多种评估指标。研究表明，PPO+LTSM 策略利用 LSTM 捕捉时间信息，能够做出更理性的决策，实现最有效的负载均衡。

With the rapid development of intelligent transportation technology, vehicle networking as a new network mode is gradually receiving widespread attention. In the context of vehicle networking, how to effectively utilize system resources and improve task execution efficiency has become an issue that needs to be resolved urgently. This paper aims to maximize the utilization of system resources and improve the overall execution efficiency of task offloading in vehicle networking, enabling vehicles to access various intelligent services through the Internet. Due to the limited computing power and energy of vehicles, task offloading can improve the performance and efficiency of complex and time-consuming tasks by leveraging edge servers. However, task offloading also involves the trade-off and coordination among multiple vehicles and servers, which poses a significant challenge for task and resource allocation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines multi-agent reinforcement learning and reverse auction mechanisms, enabling vehicles and servers to learn and optimize their bidding strategies for task offloading, achieving a fair and efficient outcome. We employ the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to train the multi-agent reinforcement learning model. Extensive experiments are conducted in our open-source Python-based simulation environment, VehicleJobScheduling, which realistically models the vehicle networking scenario and provides multiple evaluation metrics. The study reveals that the PPO+LTSM strategy utilizes LSTM to capture temporal information, enabling more rational decision-making and achieving the most effective load balance.
