Original:
"Common scheduling methods in edge cloud computing environments include fuzzy logic and machine learning. Various distributed resource scheduling methods based on random optimization have emerged [^24][^26][^27][^1], dynamically adjusting resource allocation strategies based on real-time feedback information, demonstrating good performance in specific scenarios. However, these methods face challenges, such as the need to predefine fuzzy rules, requiring significant time for design, and being limited by a static global perspective. In contrast to fuzzy logic methods, traditional machine learning methods utilize existing scheduling data to learn dynamic task scheduling strategies, reducing manual intervention. Nevertheless, the dataset used for learning may not adapt to new environments. Therefore, reinforcement learning agents trained in simulation environments have become a suitable solution to address the challenges of environmental changes [^32]."

"In edge cloud computing environments, prevalent scheduling methods encompass fuzzy logic and machine learning. A variety of distributed resource scheduling approaches rooted in random optimization have been introduced [^24][^26][^27][^1], dynamically adapting resource allocation strategies in response to real-time feedback, exhibiting commendable performance in specific scenarios. Nonetheless, these approaches encounter challenges, including the necessity to predefine fuzzy rules, substantial design time requirements, and constraints imposed by a static global perspective.

In contrast to fuzzy logic methods, traditional machine learning techniques leverage existing scheduling data to acquire dynamic task scheduling strategies, thereby diminishing manual intervention. However, the datasets employed for learning may lack adaptability to novel environments. Consequently, reinforcement learning agents trained in simulation environments emerge as a viable solution to tackle the challenges posed by environmental changes [^32]."
